# The BBN Foundation
The **BBN Foundation** is an organization founded by Skylafalls and originally meant to house most of her projects. The main goal of the BBN Foundation now is to standardize and formalize the concepts and designs used by the wider Fictional Googology community.

As of October 20th, 2025, the foundation has been dismantled. The projects that was under the organization however remains, and many documents still has the ["\[BBN\]"](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iYp6VyEhT5JeENpVRjqs7BT9yJd0l-8kHFX_ct7BZMI/edit?usp=sharing) prefix attached to their name.

An attempt of reviving it was spearheaded by Math Goblin and Stella. Currently, I (sky) have no idea how they're doing.
