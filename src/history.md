# History of Fictional Googology
The history of Fictional Googology spans back multiple years, both on the rigorous and informal front. One of the first FGisms (Fictional Googologisms) is a number created by [Mathis R.V](https://www.youtube.com/@MathisRV) on August 20th, 2021. It was on a video called ["Numbers 0 to ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING!!!"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGcE68xpuD4).

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that the video contains a lot of flashing lights and very loud noises, which can cause epileptic seizures. It's recommended to turn down the volume and brightness before viewing, especially later into the video.
> Anyone that is photosensitive should not watch it.

Despite the lack of actual entries on the video, it was pretty clear what the final number was gonna be, judging by the title of the video.

This video inspired multitudes of “epistemological ascension”-type communities and has its effects in some internet groups. This video (or its concept) also was the foundation of one of the most significant parts of an FG video; [Absolutely Everything Versions](https://fgyt.fandom.com/wiki/Absolutely_Everything_Version).

There is also general consensus that Fictional Googology began even earlier, back in June of 2021, Sergey Aytzhanov wrote a paper to go beyond Absolute Infinity mathematically, titled ["The true magnitude of Absolute Totality"](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/fictional-googology/images/4/42/The_Paper.pdf/revision/latest).

This paper spawned off a major branch of numbers, called Hypergoogology, numbers that mathematically go beyond Absolute Infinity. It was also the basis for the majority of early numbers within the rigorous FG community.

Let's explore the rest of history, [starting at the NEVER series](./informals/before-cyclings.md).
