# Cycles
**Cycles** are one of the foundational aspects of Fictional Googology, first appearing in Mathis R.V's Numbers 0 to NEVER [1/2].

As defined by the Common FG Specification, a cycle is a repeated application of a set of functions over and over again on a base entry. They are always used for reaching massive milestones and is one of the most iconic parts of Fictional Googology.

Cycles are typically displayed in a video format, and has attributes are applied to the previous cycle frame (referred to as [P]). These attributes are often displayed as a word suffixed with -ize, surrounding the previous frame.

There are many kinds of cycles which we will get into.

## Powered Cycles
**Powered Cycles** are cycles that are intended to be more chaotic and "powerful" by applying certain aspects such as [Absolutely Everything Versions](./ae-versions.md) and audiovisual effects. There are higher "powered" levels such as superpowered cycles, megapowered cycles, and so on and so forth.

These are very similar to supercycles as we'll introduce later, having many of the same patterns and effects used with only a few notable differences.

Some of the [A.E. Version](./ae-versions/index.md) that are used are:
- [Layers](./ae-versions/layers.md) - Reusing a clip / export and copy it into portions.
- [Speedramps](./ae-versions/speedramps.md) - Gradually speeding up the clip till it gets exhausted.
- [Black Hole](./ae-versions/black-holes.md): Introduced in Mathis's Part X, a black hole spawns at the center and grows bigger until it fills up the screen. Found within the explosions part.

## Supercycles
**Supercycles** are a kind of cycles that consists of copying the functions of previous cycles that has been shown and combining them into one large "supercycle". These also sometimes has extra parts added at the end that aren't a part of any cycles shown before.

> [!NOTE]
> All supercycles _are_ by definition powered cycles but not all powered cycles _are_ supercycles.
> The distinguishing feature is that supercycles contains previous cycles while most powered cycles _do not_.

**Supercycles** have a few additional unique parts separating them from traditional cycles.
- Firstly, the repeats segment (repeating the cycle entries over itself) is typically much longer then normal cycles.
  - Additionally, the repeats segment often uses a different song then the one used for the base entries (eg. [Silent Partner's Birds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYURLoKaoYI)).
- Secondly, they often has [Absolutely Everything Versions](./ae-versions/index.md) attached, which makes it problematic for photosensitive people due to the flashy nature of these segments.

There are higher levels of supercycles such as **Megacycles**, which follows SI unit measurements up till a certain point. After that point, it follows Breakology.

## Other Cycle Types

There are many other cycle types that are used throughout the Fictional Googology community. This here provides a list of some of the most commonly used ones.

- **Minicycles:** The first ever cycle type made, in Mathis R.V’s Numbers 0 to NEVER [1 / 2]. They are extremely basic, has very few frames and don’t do much.
- **"Cycle/Layer/Phase" Cycle:** One of the types of cycles made by Mathis R.V, they are fixed with a Cycle, Layer, and Phase frame with the only changes being the number is used.
- **DuplicationCcycle**: Involves a bunch of progressively faster scrolling entries grouped up into 1 entry, indicating the amount of entries being duplicated.
