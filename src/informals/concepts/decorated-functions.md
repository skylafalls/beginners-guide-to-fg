# Decorated Functions
Like normal functions, **Decorated Functions** takes in a number and spits out a different form (which is typically an overpowered variant like [masteries](./sequences.md)). Unlike normal functions, decorated functions are represented by overlaying a symbol on top of the number instead of being a normal function call.

What does this mean? It means that applying the function to a number is done not by wrapping it in the function (eg. f(x)), but rather you apply the function by overlaying a shape or different symbol over it (eg. star on top of x).

Typically, these decorated functions also have an associated effect that describes how it strengths the number.
