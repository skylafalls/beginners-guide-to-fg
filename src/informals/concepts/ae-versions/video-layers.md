# Video Layers
**Video Layers** are a type of A.E. version segment that involves layering (hence the name) videos on top of each other, to create a distorted and chaotic feeling.

> [!NOTE]
> These should not be confused with normal [Layers](./layers.md), which has a similar name but is a different concept.

**Video Layers** are quite commonly used during the end of [supercycles](../cycles.md), and almost always comes after the [megaphoto segment](./megaphoto.md). There so far isn't any examples of them being used in a different spot then usual.

The videos that are used for video layers are typically past videos from the series, for example, they use previous cycles (or supercycles), entire episodes, small number segments, previous A.E. versions, or even video layer segments themselves.
