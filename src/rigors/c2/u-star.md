To begin, let us explore a vital aspect of rFG: its logic and reasoning, a somewhat complex topic.
When doing rFG, what logic are we using?
What do we use when, for example, considering the validity of transmaximal objects?

The logic of rFG is known as **u\***. We can immediately infer that **u\*** is not something like classical logic,
as classical logic is merely a construct in RL0, which can be transcended within rFG.
We can also see that, by extension, **u\*** cannot be anything in RL0 at all considering
it can reason about things beyond RL0, such as RL1 or ⤴.

**u\*** should be seen as the intuitive metaphysical system of reasoning governing rFG as a whole.
In some sense, **u\*** will always be too intricately complex for us to ever truly approach
(every time there is a new logical leap there must always be some new aspect of **u\*** to account for it),
so instead of getting at it directly, we work by iteratively approximating it.

We can start by finding general principles of **u\*** that are near-certainly true;
then, through gradual refinement, we slowly build up our knowledge of the reasoning of **u\***.
Grander principles of **u\*** are almost impossible to reconstruct,
as these would have to be broad enough to encompass any kind of trickery we could consider.
Because of this, **u\*** is approximated from the smaller picture,
the broader picture being far too complex to truly capture in broad observations.

A very important thing to note is that **u\*** is fundamentally unformalizable.
This does not mean the practice of rFG is in any way non-rigorous or subjective –
**u\*** is a singular, objective logical system. It just means some aspects of **u\*** are “intuition-based”,
in the sense that they are too complex to be captured by any formal system.
The metaphysical picture of **u\*** is too vast to be a mere formalizable system of reasoning –
after all, that’s how **u\*** is able to reason about things such as **F<sub>0</sub>**.

This can be thought of as similar to how it is generally understood what is and isn’t a chair.
Trying to define strict formal parameters to determine _exactly_ what is and is not a chair would
be an extremely unproductive and futile endeavour; however, we can see that there is a mutually
understood intuitive (i.e. informal) view of what is considered to be a chair and what isn’t
(this analogy has imperfections, but it gets the point across).

Cases of inaccuracies may occur – in the chair analogy, you may have cases where some believe
a given object to be a chair while others don’t.
In the case of **u\***, we just have to consider the inaccuracy and correct it
by refining our approximation of **u\*** further.

Because of this, **u\*** can be reconstructed and approximated in a rigorous way,
and we can iterate our precision to be as rigorous as we could need.
Through this methodology, **u\*** is an extremely powerful system and
can be used to talk about many things that would simply not be discussable
in a reasonable or logical manner using any other system of reasoning.
