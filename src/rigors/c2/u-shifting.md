# u\*-shifting
**u\*-shifting** is a natural phenomenon that comes to light when examining some of the specific properties of u\*.
It is the answer to the question of how we can examine things such as E<sub>0</sub> without
triggering the principle of explosion (a principle of classical logic which states that everything is provable with contradictions).

**u\*-shifting** is basically the act of ontologically shifting certain logical statements down in importance.
**u\*-shifting** makes certain objects “only locally true”, while making others “globally true”.

What we mean by this is that objects which are false according to u\* do not have their status of existence removed entirely –
instead, they are just seen as having some “inferior existence” of sorts,
only having some value of truth when purely considering some local area such as within another system of reasoning.

Due to this, u\* has the ability to reason about logical systems themselves,
**u\*-shifting** them if they contradict it. We see that **u\*-shifted** logical
systems are true under their own assumptions –
it’s just that this truth is inferior compared to the global truth of u\*.

## i\*
The individual assumptions of an object – that is, the things an individual object hold as true –
are called the object’s **i\***. We notate the i* of some object 𝔒 as **i\*(𝔒)**.
Let us examine some contradictory i* such as **i\*(E<sub>0</sub>)**.
We can see that **i\*(E<sub>0</sub>)** contains the statement “greater than itself”.
Is this statement necessarily u\*-shifted?
Well, the answer is _no_, and the reason why is that not all contradictions are treated the same way.

In the context of u\*, there are only two general kinds of contradictions: _local inconsistencies_,
where an **i\*** merely holds internal contradictions (i.e. contradicts itself), and _global inconsistencies_,
where an **i\*** contradicts u\* as a whole.
Locally inconsistent **i\*** can exist without being u\*-shifted;
globally inconsistent **i\***, on the other hand, must **always** be u\*-shifted.

We can see that the statement “greater than itself” is merely locally inconsistent;
it doesn’t contradict u\* at all, and therefore does not require any sort of u\*-shift.
In fact, upon inspection, we can see that i\*(E<sub>0</sub>) has no global inconsistencies at all,
and therefore needn’t be u\*-shifted. We can hold locally inconsistent i\* as true;
it’s just that we reject any global inconsistencies that could follow.

Because of this, it may seem like proof by contradiction does not work; after all,
if certain types of contradictions are held as true, then **surely** proof by contradiction fades into meaninglessness.
However, this is not the case due to u\*-shifting.

Say we have a statement P<sub>1</sub> and another statement P<sub>2</sub>.
If we know that P<sub>2</sub> is absolutely true within u\* and we show that P<sub>1</sub>
contradicts P<sub>2</sub>, then that can be used as proof that P<sub>1</sub> is false –
or, more accurately, u\*-shifted – since we know that if P<sub>2</sub> is true within u\*,
then anything contradictory to it is necessarily globally inconsistent.
