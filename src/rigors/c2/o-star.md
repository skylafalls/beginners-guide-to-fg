# o\*
Within rFG, **o\*** are very interesting concepts which have already been found to have many fruitful benefits,
most of which are beyond the scope of everything we have discussed so far.

**o\*** are basically where we consider the entirety of rFG under some alternative system
of reasoning other than u\*. Due to the very nature of this, all **o\*** are u\*-shifted by
necessity and are strictly only true within the **o\*** itself.
In fact, **o\*** are merely special types of i\*; specifically,
they are types of i\* which aim to capture the entirety of rFG under
an alternative system of reasoning rather than limiting themselves to
some specific area of discourse.

It should be noted that **o\*** are **_not_** serious ways of going about rFG
(unless you _really_ want to get experimental);
rather they merely allow for us to show the behaviour of other assumptions and
systems of reasoning temporarily, as we must automatically assume u\* when engaging in rFG,
regardless of personal beliefs.

An example of an **o\*** could be the **o\*** where we view all of rFG as being completely formalizable.
We can call this stance **Hyperological Formalism** (HGF for short),
and notate its corresponding **o\*** as **o\***(HGF). Within **o\***(HGF),
we see every single object as fully describable in a formal system.

⤳ is an interesting symbol that can be used to show how different objects behave in different **o\***.
For some **o\*** – call it **o\***(𝔏) – and some object 𝔄, 𝔄 ⤳ **o\***(𝔏) is the object that,
when considered in the global truth of u\*, behaves the exact same way as 𝔄 does when considered in **o\***(𝔏).

For example, let us consider F<sub>0</sub> ⤳ **o\***(HGF). We can see that given HGF, all rFG objects are formalizable. Because of this, when inserted in **o\***(HGF), F<sub>0</sub> – being unformalizable – would contradict the stance upheld by HGF and therefore be reduced to a formalizable approximation of itself. We can give this approximation the symbol F<sup>−</sup>.
