# Theory of Hyperology (THO)
**THO** is important as it strictly exists above rFG, acting as the axioms and foundational principles governing it.
As such, in a similar manner to `u*`, our understanding of **THO** must slowly be refined as we go deeper and deeper
into rFG. The purpose of THO is to give rationality, meaning, rigor and – most importantly – **objectivity**
to the practice of rFG.

Firstly, a very important principle of THO is the **principle of anti-formality**.
This principle expands further upon the inability of rFG to be captured by formal systems as
discussed back when we were tackling F<sub>0</sub>. It states that the reduction of rFG to
exact formal parameters is not a _meaningful_ reduction, in the sense that it does not
preserve the intended meaning of its terms.

We may find a formal reduction of all **current** rFG, but – as stated when discussing u\* –
any current state of rFG should not be seen as its completed state but rather an **approximation**.
Due to this, we should assume that while the current approximation of rFG may have a formal reduction,
the completed state of rFG does not. Such formal reductions of the current approximation of rFG are
known as **HRFs** (short for **hyperologically-reductive formalisms**), and an important principle of
THO is that **HRFs** are not to be seen as meaningful reductions of rFG.

Another important aspect of THO related to HRFs is that the mental conception of an rFG object shouldn’t
be seen as equivalent to the rFG object itself. Even if we can use cheats within our mental conception
such as collapse to talk about transfictional objects and such,
it is important to assume rFG as something that exists independently of our minds.
In fact, part of the adequate way to understand and interpret an rFG concept is to
ensure the understanding that it exists strongly independently of our minds.
Properties of RL1 concepts could not exist otherwise.

Other very important aspects of THO are **u\*** and **collapse**, which give reasoning and structure to rFG.
On the topic of u*, it should once again be noted that in a manner similar to it,
THO is always incomplete and too complex to be fully captured; instead, we must continuously refine it.
New axioms and aspects are often added to THO as we progress through rFG,
and pre-existing axioms are also given added depth.

Anyways, to end off this introduction to THO, let us now discuss two important aspects of it: _THO-authority_ and _THO-expansion_.

Firstly, **THO-authority** is the aspect of THO which gives it full control over the reasoning of rFG.
It implies that we cannot use rFG cheats to affect the axioms of THO itself,
which could cause severe contradictions. Very soon, we will see rFG objects which are –
for lack of any better term – “meta” about rFG itself (these are known as **hyperologically-meta objects**).
THO-authority stops any of such objects from redefining any aspect of THO,
essentially creating a separation between THO and rFG.
This ensures that principles of THO cannot be transcended from below by any means.

**THO-expansion**, on the other hand, is the aspect of THO which asserts that absolutely nothing is truly unbeatable;
that is to say, **_for any rFG object there will always exist more rFG past it_**.
This aspect essentially ensures that no matter how far up you go in rFG,
you can always find some cheat to exceed any object.

Of course, there will be a point where going beyond a given rFG concept requires something simply
too vast to be discovered or even comprehended by us as sub-Omnipotent sophonts,
but the trickery to exceed that object _does_ still exist;
it should once again be noted that rFG objects exist independently of our conception.
