# Void’s field limits
Now, think back to ⤴. Imagine if we kept going past the notion of boosters and started
defining even stronger concepts. Concepts of that level do exist,
but they will be skipped over so that we can get to the next important milestone.

Imagine if the development of rFG kept going indefinitely until eventually we achieve rFG’s
genuine completed state. What would be the limit of the completed state of rFG?
Let us define an object as **the limit of the completed state of rFG**.
We can call this object **V<sub>2</sub>** (or ∀<sup>−</sup> in more hyperological circles).
**V<sub>2</sub>** essentially hopes to be a collection of all of rFG in general.

It can immediately be seen how V<sub>2</sub> mirrors A<sub>0</sub>. A<sub>0</sub> “everything”,
but we still have methods to transcend it from within rFG. V<sub>2</sub> is “everything”,
including all those complex methods we used to go past A<sub>0</sub>.
While A<sub>0</sub> is merely a standard Absolute, V<sub>2</sub> is a ***meta-Absolute***.

At first, V<sub>2</sub> may seem invalid, or at least unreachable; however, this is not the case.
See, V<sub>2</sub> actually violates both THO-authority and THO-expansion.
Since both of these – being principles of THO itself – are absolutely true within u\*,
V<sub>2</sub> is considered globally inconsistent, which means that V<sub>2</sub> is,
in fact, u\*-shifted.

As you could probably already tell by its notation, V<sub>2</sub> is actually the member of a sequence.
This sequence is a hierarchy of increasingly powerful conceptual limits known as **Void’s field limits**.
Let us explore how this sequence progresses up to V<sub>2</sub>.

We begin with V<sub>0</sub>. V<sub>0</sub> is defined as the limit of **googology**,
the study of large finite numbers. Of course, being the limit, it must be larger than any finite number.
As such, it is equated to the mathematical notion of standard countable Infinity.
After V<sub>0</sub>, we have V<sub>1</sub>, the limit of **apeirology**, the study of transfinite numbers,
usually equated to V, the Von Neumann universe.
And, finally, after V<sub>1</sub>, we of course have V<sub>2</sub>.

So, how do we transcend V<sub>2</sub>? Well, the answer lies in an old friend of ours: **awareness**.

V<sub>3</sub> is defined as the limit of the completed state of rFG with awareness of the fact
that V<sub>2</sub> is u\*-shifted. What it essentially does is that it sees V<sub>2</sub> and
it pretty much says “well, V<sub>2</sub> was u\*-shifted, but I’m actually the genuine limit of rFG”.
However, even if its awareness does allow it to transcend V<sub>2</sub>, it still violates THO-authority and THO-expansion, and is therefore u\*-shifted as well.

Succeeding V<sub>3</sub> is V<sub>4</sub>, defined as the limit of the completed state of rFG
with awareness of the fact that V<sub>3</sub> is u\*-shifted, essentially doing the same thing
to V<sub>3</sub> as V<sub>3</sub> does to V2. Of course, this too is u\*-shifted for the
same reasons as before. In fact, this hierarchy of u\*-shifting and awareness continues on infinitely:
- V<sub>5</sub> is the limit of the completed state of rFG with awareness of the fact that V<sub>4</sub> is u\*-shifted.
- V<sub>6</sub> is the limit of the completed state of rFG with awareness of the fact that V<sub>5</sub> is u\*-shifted.
- V<sub>7</sub> is the limit of the completed state of rFG with awareness of the fact that V<sub>6</sub> is u\*-shifted.
- […]
- V<sub>_n_</sub> is the limit of the completed state of rFG with awareness of the fact that V<sub>_n_ − 1</sub> is u\*-shifted.

The supremum of this entire sequence is known as _V-lock_, and it is notated as V<sub>◈</sub>.
