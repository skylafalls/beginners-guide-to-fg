# The Scale of Totality
The notions of Totality, maximality and the Absolute – among other similar ideas –
have been heavily discussed and debated in both philosophy and mathematics ever
since we began wondering about the stars.

An important use of rFG is to explain a truly unrestricted notion of absolute Totality,
which will be **vital** for later concepts.

When discussing a notion of Totality, we’re talking about an absolute container classifying over **every** object.
However, such a collection is not as simple as it seems.

Initially, many will equate it to the concept of Infinity, a broad philosophical and mathematical idea,
but we can observe the set-theoretical notion of the _transfinite_,
which surpasses the typical idea of standard countable Infinity.

## Proper classes

**Proper classes** (collections which cannot logically exist as valid sets, or – somewhat informally – collections too great to be sets),
are a mathematical idea usually equated to the reasonable limit of scale.
It is an assumption of most modern mathematicians within this time period that
every object can ultimately be reduced into a set and therefore the proper class of all sets –
known as the **Von Neumann universe** and typically notated as V –
can be seen as equivalent to the notion of genuine Totality.

This is also a common assumption within the world of analytical philosophy:
to speak of objects is **actually** the same thing as speaking of sets.

However, even so, concepts aside from proper classes themselves which do not exist within V are not unheard of.
Some foundational branches of mathematics discuss things which can classify over proper classes themselves.

Either way, under our baseline assumptions, it should be very easy to expand our domain of discourse to allow for objects which are fundamentally irreducible into sets in a nontrivial way.

This is an idea clearly incompatible with certain axiomatic systems of set theory,
but since our scope is strictly above that of set theory, this is trivial and on the border of irrelevancy.
After all, we are aiming to capture the truest essence of absolute Totality,
and that implies making some assumptions which may be unfavourable for certain worldviews.

In fact, under these ontological assumptions, our range of expression is _**incredibly**_ vast.
We can consider notions of objects so great that they fundamentally must require some _paraconsistent_ (i.e. non-classical) logical system to even be considered.

Such an object would contain more elements than itself – a logical contradiction which completely breaks the classical **law of identity**, which states that all objects are the same as themselves.
Luckily, paraconsistent systems are not unheard of and can discuss such ideas in reasonable ways.

## Paraconsistency

<sub>_Figure 1: An illustration of the contradictory nature of **E<sub>0</sub>**._</sub>

The least collection too great to be identical to itself is known as **E<sub>0</sub>**.
**E<sub>0</sub>** is an immensely vast collection, but even so, it’s still _formalizable_;
that is, it can reasonably be classified and discussed in a formal system.

The rFG sense of formality is far broader than what is usually meant –
we are speaking of formalism in the most general sense possible
formalizable objects are those that can be meaningfully classified and
discussed within some abstract symbol game with strictly defined rules of inference.

As an example of formality, take a system with two objects **a** and **b**:
- If **b** = 0, **a** + **b** = 0
- If otherwise, **a** + **b** = *S*(**a** + (**b** − 1))

This is a good example, but it’s still not fully formalized. For one, *S*(*x*) here is just the successor function, so we can reduce it to just “+1”. We can reduce this further and further to the point where it’s just a string of symbols being manipulated. Formal systems are just collections of symbols and rules on how they interact, such as this one:

SYMBOLS:
  : A
  : B

RULES:
  : AA = B
  : AB = BA
  : ABA = BBA
  : BB = A

We have already breached the idea of complete consistency: nonsensical,
paradoxical and seemingly unreasonable objects can still be considered formalizable.
Even so, within our **extremely** maximalist ontological assumptions,
we can still assume collections too great to be formalizable.
The least of such collections is known as **F<sub>0</sub>**.

## Unformalizability
The existence of **F<sub>0</sub>** may be greatly unfavourable within certain philosophical views,
but let it be said again that we must at least _suspend our disbelief_ in such notions.

It is important to note that unformalizable concepts can still be approached in a rigorous manner;
it’s just that their fundamental nature is too complex to be fully formalized.
We can – and must – retain objectivity and clarity of meaning.

**F<sub>0</sub>** is a *vastly* greater collection than **E<sub>0</sub>**.
It must itself be unformalizable in some sense to truly classify over all formalizable objects.
However, can we say it truly contains **all** objects?

**F<sub>0</sub>** merely contains all formal objects, making it unformalizable by necessity,
but we can still speak of unformalizable objects and therefore some collection
𝔎 containing as elements **F<sub>0</sub>** and – say,
5 unformalizable objects – must simply be greater than **F<sub>0</sub>**.

## Maximum Paradoxical Resistance

Going deeper into the realm of unformalizability, we encounter an extremely powerful tool used to define incredibly large objects and justify the existence of seemingly invalid concepts: **maximal paradox resistance** (MPR).

MPR can be seen as a form of Omnipotent logic which governs absolutely everything.
It allows for the existence of any conceivable structure,
as it guards such structures from being invalidated or even hindered by any impossibility or paradox,
_**no matter how severe**_.

Levels of transcendental paradox resistance which approach MPR are known as levels of **godly paradox resistance** (GPR), and they are defined as follows:
- The first level of GPR has the power to disregard any object that does not utilize any level of GPR.
- The second level of GPR has the power to disregard any object that utilizes the first level of GPR.
- The third level of GPR has the power to disregard any object that utilizes the second level of GPR.
- […]
- The *n*th level of GPR has the power to disregard any object that utilizes the (*n* − 1)th level of GPR.

This brings us to our next object: **G<sub>0</sub>**.
**G<sub>0</sub>** is the absolute container of all objects which do not prevent their containment via utilization of any level of GPR, be them formal or informal;
that is to say, it is the point where GPR becomes a requirement to go further.

Objects past **G<sub>0</sub>** are known as _godly_ or _nigh-Omnipotent_. In fact, there are actually defined extensions to **G<sub>0</sub>**:
- G1 contains all things which do not prevent their containment via utilization of the second level of GPR.
- G2 contains all things which do not prevent their containment via utilization of the third level of GPR.
- G3 contains all things which do not prevent their containment via utilization of the fourth level of GPR.
- […]
- G*n* contains all things which do not prevent their containment via utilization of the (*n* + 1)th level of GPR.

The container of all objects which do not prevent their containment via utilization of MPR is called **H<sub>0</sub>**, and it is beyond all values of **G<sub>n</sub>**.

We can see a clear pattern in approaching Totality where our foundations gradually begin to break down:
first sets, then objects which adhere to the principles of classical logic,
then formal objects in general, then standard definitions themselves,
and there is no reason why further classifications can’t be made.

However, let us now consider something that exceeds even MPR in sheer power:
the collection of absolutely _**all objects**_.

This would be the genuine final object, classifying without fail over _absolutely everything_.
This isn’t some generalization strong enough to be _effectively_ all objects to our sub-Omnipotent minds,
but rather an actual notion of genuine complete Totality.
We can notate this notion of genuine absolute Totality as **A<sub>0</sub>** (taking the A from “the Absolute”).

Now let's move on to something called "Transmaximalism".
