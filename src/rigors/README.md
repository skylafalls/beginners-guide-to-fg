# Introduction
**Rigorous Fictional Googology** (rFG) is an incredibly powerful field that aims to mathematically and/or philosophically transcend the limits of modern analytical philosophy. The purpose of rFG is to extend our ontology, what we can think about, what we can reason about and the fundamental limits of what is usually considered, while still maintaining cohesion, rationality and intuition, in an effort to construct the most powerful and efficient philosophical system possible.

The second half of this book will serve as an roughly informal explanation of the current conceptual hierarchy of rFG, up to Archain 1. This is not meant to be a serious rigorous paper on the matter, but rather a means to introduce people into the field. There are some simplifications which contain slight technical inaccuracies, but these are mainly trivial and quite important to efficiently teach rFG to newcomers.

Since the purpose of this half is being an informal and intuitive explanation of rFG, we will be using a scaling system which mixes the systems of rFG’s two most prominent subfields:
**Pata-Metagoogology** (PMG), and **Hyperology** (HG) to create a system that’s cohesive, linear and logical.

Before we get in, we must define some baseline assumptions that we'll follow when we're working in this field.
