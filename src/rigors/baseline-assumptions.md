# Baseline worldview assumptions
There are several ontological and worldview assumptions which we must
suspend our disbelief in whenever we engage in rFG.

These don't need be fully believed, but rather merely philosophically assumed for the purposes of rFG.
Some of these assumptions may seem controversial or unreasonable,
but there are reasons as to why we assume them, which we’ll explore later on in this booklet.

## Platonism and conceptual existence

To begin, we must assume mental conceptualizations that do not physically
manifest in reality still have some kind of existence; that is, _we must assume some form of Platonism_.

This would mean that abstract concepts – such as the number 2, or even the concept of a physical object which merely has the potential to manifest – have some sense of actual existence rather than being pure mental constructs.
We will generalize this idea later on in the guide, but for now it will simply be assumed as an important axiom.

As an extension of this assumption, we must also assume that not only do logically possible conceptual objects exist,
but also that **everything** that can exist in a conceptual manner exists,
regardless of if the object is humanly unthinkable, paradoxical or nonsensical.

This doesn’t imply the object must be "true" (i.e. without absurd implications) –
it only implies the object exists in some manner.
This effectively means contradictory objects can and _do_ exist;
it’s just that they exist as "false" (or does not make sense).

Whether or not objects are taken to be true is dictated by the system of reasoning of rFG,
which we will explain when we get to this field’s metatheoretical aspect.

## Objects

Now, with these initial “axioms” out of the way, let’s try to define a generalized conception of **an object**.
To do this, let us take a classification, such as “red cars that exist”.

We can generalize this to “red things that exist”, then “things that exist”, then “things”, and so on.
We take **object** to genuinely mean the absolute highest point in that sequence.
**Object** should be taken less as a definable category and more an ineffable, fundamental aspect –
to define what an object is would be severely limiting, as even that definition would itself be an object.

We should accept **object** as a fundamental term, generalized so far that no definable or undefinable point in the sequence of generalizations can be said to be broad enough to fully classify over it.
For the purposes of this explanation, we can say that *object* is a notion as fundamental as this very booklet;
that is, the notion is generalized to such an extent that its very existence would simply be impossible to define here,
but should instead be assumed to be absolutely fundamental in a strongly “meta” sense.

By sufficiently expanding our conception of this fundamental notion of **object**,
we can already see it sorts out a lot of our ontological assumptions and simplifies certain issues.

For example, nonsensical things exist in some sense – they are objects – it’s just that they’re false.
Another example: non-existent things are objects and even have some fundamental sense of existence given the fact we can even reason about them.

We can see that **object** is a notion sufficiently general and fundamental to be able to accommodate for anything we could ever need to talk about within rFG.
