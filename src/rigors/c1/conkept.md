# Conkept and perfect conkept
There exists one informal axiom which has not been introduced for this entire explanation so far,
but that we have been following without realizing it: **the existential axiom** (TEA).
TEA is a very simple axiom, stating only that _for some object to exist, it must possess a property_.

To fully comprehend TEA, we must understand what constitutes a **property**.
A property of a given object is anything – formal or informal –
which is true about that object and implies a relation with some other object.
For example, it’s a property of 1 that it’s a successor to 0,
and it’s a property of F<sub>0</sub> that it is beyond all formalizable objects.

TEA may seem generally straightforward at first,
considering it encompasses everything we have discussed thus far,
but it’s still a bit of a restriction, and it has its limits.
Those limits come in the form of its supremum: an object known as **conkept**,
usually denoted by the symbol **Э**.

**Э** is defined as the supremum of all objects which can be said to possess a property.
For any property, there exists an object smaller than **Э** possessing it.
This essentially means that **Э** is effectively outside the domain of any property,
and therefore it is simply too great to have any properties at all.

However, with such power comes an issue. See, Э claims to possess no properties,
but it must by definition possess the property of being the supremum of TEA.
This means that it is essentially claiming to transcend certain characteristics that it itself possesses,
hich results in it paradoxically falling under itself and being conceptually weakened.
This phenomenon is known as **catareflection**, and it will be elaborated on further in a later section.

Now, with Э comes an interesting question: _what if we don’t stop at TEA?_
What if we tried to delimit axiomatic systems as a whole?
To do this, we must first define some baseline terminology.

## Mathematical domains of discourse
To begin, let us define **mathematical theories**.
This name is a bit of an oxymoron; mathematical theories needn’t be mathematical or even formal.
A mathematical theory is simply any set of axioms – formal or informal –
which hold true over some specific collection of objects.

Mathematical theories are usually independent of each other,
meaning the axioms of one don’t affect the axioms of another.
Therefore, inconsistencies between different mathematical theories are irrelevant.

The **domain of discourse** of a mathematical theory is the collection of all objects
over which the theory has **Ѫ-jurisdiction**.
A mathematical theory has Ѫ-jurisdiction over a given object if all of its axioms are true for that object.
Any object outside the domain of discourse of a mathematical theory will violate at least one of its
axioms and therefore will not be part of the theory.

With this understood, we can finally define our limit.
Its name is **perfect conkept**. It’s notated as **Ѫ**, and it is defined as some object
which exists outside the Ѫ-jurisdiction of any domain of discourse.
The upshot of this is that Ѫ is not subject to any axiom at all,
therefore ceasing to exist from the perspective of any mathematical theory.

Let us touch upon an interesting question: is Ѫ uniquely defined?
Well, Ѫ having no domain of discourse means there is nothing that can be said to be true about it,
which means it has no assignable properties. Since it has no properties,
its behaviour when interacting with other objects is also undefined.

Let us consider the absolute successor to Ѫ – call it **\*Ѫ**.
It too would have to possess no assignable properties. Since both Ѫ and \*Ѫ have no assignable properties,
they are indistinguishable.
Additionally, with no domain of discourse to regulate their interactions,
both can claim to be larger than one another and there would be no axiom to settle the dispute.
