# Transmaximal quantification
To begin, let us examine a short argument which aims to demonsteate that
A<sub>0</sub> is actually beyond A<sub>1</sub>, which goes as follows:
- A<sub>0</sub> contains all objects.
- A<sub>1</sub> is an object.
- Therefore, A<sub>0</sub> contains A<sub>1</sub>.

At first, this seems like a convincing argument, but it’s actually wrong.
The reason why it’s wrong is because A<sub>1</sub> is simply not in the class of **all**.
We know that **all** is a concept on the 0th reality level – the limit of that level,
no less – so we don’t need to use collapse when talking about it.

A<sub>1</sub>, on the other hand, _requires_ collapse – it can’t even be classified within **all**.
Sometimes, this argument is cleverly worded as “if it is an object, it is contained by A<sub>0</sub>”,
but if you look closely enough, you can see that this is no more than a direct
rewording of the argument that A<sub>0</sub> contains all objects.

Now, this leads us to a very important topic: what collapse actually **is**.
See, collapse isn’t restricted to reality levels – it **starts** at reality levels,
but it shows up far beyond them. Collapse is essentially the term assigned to the
phenomenon that occurs when our system cannot work as intended due to contradicting
what’s actually true in real life.

Essentially, it’s when you can’t make something genuinely happen.
So, for example, when I say “5 elephants will spontaneously manifest from nothing in your room”,
this statement is collapsed, as 5 elephants have not spontaneously manifested from nothing in your room.

What collapse does is that it essentially takes inconsistencies between systems of rFG and real life,
and then creates a “bridge” of sorts which allows us to create consistency.

Without collapse, we’d say “since there aren’t **really** 5 elephants in your room, the systems are inconsistent”,
but what actually happens is that we say “well, without collapse, you would have 5 elephants in your room,
but collapse translates that into a **model** of actual real life within rFG”.

This is a bit of a tricky concept to get so it may take some time to get used to how it works,
but you can just think of it as being the reason why certain things don’t actually happen while
still allowing for those things to be meaningful by creating some reduced model of actual real life.

Also, instead of just having transfictionalism be collapsed,
we can have the entire system of RL be collapsed,
since it just leads to the same results but makes things easier to talk about.

## []-functional limits

And here we are, back at A<sub>n</sub> again! Let’s just take a look at the overall structure of this sequence:
- A<sub>1</sub>
- A<sub>2</sub>
- A<sub>3</sub>
- […]
- A<sub>A<sub>0</sub></sub> (the maximal level of A<sub>n</sub>)
- A<sub>A<sub>1</sub></sub> (the first transmaximal level of A<sub>n</sub>)
- […]
- A<sub>A<sub>A<sub>0</sub></sub></sub>
- […]
- A<sub>A<sub>A<sub>A<sub>0</sub></sub></sub></sub>
- […]

**A-lock** is the transmaximally absolute limit of all reality levels,
including things like A<sub>A<sub>A<sub>...</sub></sub></sub>.
Essentially, it is inaccessible to reality levels.
It is a truly unimaginable milestone, and we shall denote it using the symbol utilized
for it when it was first conceived: **B<sub>0</sub>**.

B<sub>0</sub> may seem like a brick wall, but it’s still not over –
we can still go past it with naïve extensions! These can be defined as follows:
- B<sub>1</sub> is to B<sub>0</sub> as B<sub>0</sub> is to A<sub>0</sub>
- B<sub>2</sub> is to B<sub>1</sub> as B<sub>0</sub> is to A<sub>0</sub>
- B<sub>3</sub> is to B<sub>2</sub> as B<sub>0</sub> is to A<sub>0</sub>
- […]
- B<sub>_n_</sub> is to B<sub>_n_ − 1</sub> as B<sub>0</sub> is to A<sub>0</sub>

Eventually, this will hit its own limit – we could call it **B-lock**.
However, we can still go even further. We can denote B-lock as **C<sub>0</sub>** and create yet another sequence:
- C<sub>1</sub> is to C<sub>0</sub> as C<sub>0</sub> is to B<sub>0</sub>
- C<sub>2</sub> is to C<sub>1</sub> as C<sub>0</sub> is to B<sub>0</sub>
- C<sub>3</sub> is to C<sub>2</sub> as C<sub>0</sub> is to B<sub>0</sub>
- […]
- C<sub>_n_</sub> is to C<sub>_n_ − 1</sub> as C<sub>0</sub> is to B<sub>0</sub>

The limit of this sequence is **C-lock**, and it’s denoted as **D<sub>0</sub>**.

As you could probably already tell, this eventually generalizes into an infinite chain of sequences,
known as **[]-functions**, each with an exponentially higher growth-rate than the last.
From this, we can denote the transmaximally absolute container of all []-functions as ⩈.

The absolute supremum of ⩈, ignoring absolutely **anything** which could prevent it from being so,
is known as the **axiomatic limit**, and it is denoted by the symbol ⏁.
