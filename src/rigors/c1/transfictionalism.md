# Transfictionalism and reality levels
The first concept we’re going to introduce might be familiar to some who may be reading this explanation.
It may not seem relevant now, but I’ll explain its importance later.
It’s based on the **realness levels** from rFG’s sister field of Hypercosmology,
and its name is **reality levels** (RL for short).

The 0th reality level contains everything that exists conceptually or metaphysically.
Some may use the word **fiction** to describe this level, but that can be a slight misnomer.
The 0th reality level gets quite complex and philosophical when we try to define strict
limits to what it contains, but this is a subject matter that doesn’t hold much relevancy.

On the other hand, the 1st reality level is the world in which we exist and consider
0th-reality-level ideas such as E<sub>0</sub> – it’s the level on which we discuss all of these concepts.

The reason why these are important is because they lead to a concept known as **transfictionalism**.
No sane person would genuinely believe that transfictionalism actually exists,
but keep in mind that is not the point – you only have to suspend your disbelief in its existence,
like you would with – for example – proper classes:
you don’t need to believe a proper-class-sized structure genuinely exists in real life to study it!

An intuitive explanation of transfictionalism goes something like this:
what is the most powerful thing you could think of?
Something with E<sub>0</sub> power? F<sub>0</sub> power? G<sub>0</sub> power?
Hell, something with A<sub>0</sub> power?
If you thought of something transfictional, it’d genuinely manifest into real life.
An object is transfictional if its existence on the 0th reality level
implies it existence on the 1st reality level.

## Collapsing

This idea is, admittedly, quite absurd, but it’s still important.
Additionally, it’s not restrained to things we can think of –
any object can be transfictional, so long as its natural existence in the
0th reality level implies it naturally exists in the 1st reality level as well.
For example, if “I have wings” was to be taken as a transfictional statement,
I’d genuinely have wings in real life right now.

This is where **collapse** comes in. When I say “I have wings, and I mean this transfictionally”…
I still don’t have wings. Collapse is the name given to this phenomenon.
It’s basically a “reduction” that occurs when speaking of these kinds of concepts.
Because of collapse, I don’t have wings – _the idea of transfictionalism is collapsed_.

If transfictionalism wasn’t collapsed, I’d genuinely have wings right now, which is impossible,
so it can be said that collapse allows us to discuss ideas that are genuinely impossible.
It allows us to “model” concepts too strong to exist within the 0th reality level
by creating a reduced version of those concepts.

All of this leads to a very important idea:
_**transfictionalism, even when collapsed, allows us to go beyond A<sub>0</sub>**_.
But how could that be?

## Awareness of RLs

Well, first, let’s examine un-collapsed transfictionalism.
Obviously, this is impossible, but let us briefly consider it.
We can obviously prove un-collapsed transfictionalism would clearly beat A<sub>0</sub>:
you can think of a character with A<sub>0</sub> power, but that 0th-reality-level character
is still in the 0th reality level, while an un-collapsed transfictional object
would be able to breach into the 1st reality level.

Now, it’s time for the trickier part: proving collapsed transfictionalism goes beyond A<sub>0</sub>.
To do this, we must introduce a new concept: **awareness**.
Awareness is basically what a definition can quantify over.
It’s a very subtle concept, only really showing up in post-G<sub>0</sub> levels,
but it can be thought of as what a definition “accounts for”.

Let’s look at A<sub>0</sub>. A<sub>0</sub> is a concept in the 0th reality level.
When we say that it contains everything, we genuinely mean **everything**,
which from the perspective of a 0th-reality-level concept would be the entirety of the 0th reality level.
It’s not aware of anything outside of its own level.

Think of yourself in real life when you say **everything**.
When you colloquially refer to an idea of everything,
you refer to the entirety of your real-life level (the 1st reality level),
because you can’t be aware of anything outside of it.

When collapsing transfictionalism, its awareness remains.
This means that transfictional objects are still aware of the 1st reality level,
as we are explicitly stating things *about* that level whenever we discuss them.
This means the 1st reality level is now included in the set of things collapsed
transfictional objects can quantify over.

So, with the baseline for our proof done, let’s actually formulate it:
- **Everything** refers to the entirety of the 0th reality level.
	- We can talk about the notion of everything in real life.
	- When defining this notion, it doesn’t escape into the 1st reality level.
	- Therefore, **everything** can be neatly classified as a 0th-reality-level idea.
- **Everything** strictly refers to the 0th reality level and does not quantify over the 1st reality level, which means it must have a 0th-reality-level awareness.
- The definition of transfictionalism explicitly refers to the 1st reality level, so collapsed or not, it has awareness of that level.
- This means transfictionalism can quantify over more than the 0th reality level; in other words, it can quantify over more than **everything**.
-
From this point on, we’ll be abbreviating **0th reality level** to just
**RL0** and **1st reality level** to just **RL1**. Additionally,
every single concept beyond this point will require some form of suspension of disbelief,
as that’s what separates genuinely interesting philosophical study from insane mysticist conspiracies.

## RL2 and higher

With this understood, let us now define a new reality level: **RL2**. RL2 is to RL1 as RL1 is to RL0;
it would essentially be something that’d see us as abstract conceptual ideas.
Nothing you do in RL0 could ever force an RL0 object out into RL1 due to collapse;
RL2 would be so strong that nothing you could do in RL1 could ever get you there,
even if you were a real-life Omnipotent.

Higher reality levels are defined analogously:
- RL3 is to RL2 as RL1 is to RL0.
- RL4 is to RL3 as RL1 is to RL0.
- RL5 is to RL4 as RL1 is to RL0.
- […]
- RL**n** is to RL(**n** − 1) as RL1 is to RL0.

So, as we have seen, A<sub>0</sub> serves as the limit of RL0 (i.e. the highest thing that can exist within RL0),
so let us now skip ahead to A<sub>1</sub>. A<sub>1</sub> is the limit of RL1, meaning it’s more powerful than anything transfictional
After that, A<sub>2</sub> is the limit of RL2, meaning it’s more powerful than some form of transfictionalism
that goes from RL1 to RL2 instead of RL0 to RL1. We can continue on with this sequence:
- A<sub>3</sub> is the limit of RL3.
- A<sub>4</sub> is the limit of RL4.
- A<sub>5</sub> is the limit of RL5.
- […]
- A<sub>**n**</sub> is the limit of RL**n**.

A<sub>0</sub> is absolutely maximal, but A<sub>1</sub> is so strong that it dwarfs even absolute true maximality –
it is transmaximal, and so is every member of the A<sub>**n**</sub> hierarchy succeeding it.
We can continue this hierarchy as far as we desire, with things such as A<sub>A<sub>0</sub></sub>.

Now, allow us now to discuss the quantification of transmaximal objects.
