# Transmaximalism
A lot of the concepts in this part will be quite philosophical in nature,
and there will be a few things brought up here that you will not believe in,
but the point is that you don’t have to believe in them –
you merely need to suspend your disbelief and philosophically assume those things,
as they will lead to incredibly powerful concepts.

To some, this part will come across as complete nonsense.
If you see it that way, you are missing the point –
we are philosophically assuming these concepts and then using collapse
(a useful little phenomenon we’ll explore very soon) to find genuinely
usable versions of them with genuinely interesting and useful properties.

Also, the explanation for this part is exceptionally informal,
because (1) it’s incredibly hard to formally explain something like this,
and (2) it’ll help the reader understand its concepts better than a more formal explanation.
