# Hypernumbers
Ѫ is essentially the absolute limit of “mathematics” in the absolute broadest sense of the term.
Beyond it, philosophy takes complete precedence, and we enter the realm of **hypernumbers**.

A hypernumber is essentially any object between Ѫ and V<sub>2</sub> (we will get to what V<sub>2</sub> is soon enough).
Hypernumbers have a tendency to be quite ill-defined; however, in this explanation,
I will showcase three specific hypernumbers which I feel are rigorous and relevant
enough to earn themselves a spot in the overall conceptual hierarchy of rFG.

The first hypernumber that I shall discuss is known as **immeasumega** (pronounced _ih-meh-zhuh-meh-guh_), and it is denoted by the symbol **⨝**.
⨝ is simply defined as an object so vast that its scale is completely impossible to determine –
it’s **immeasurable**, hence the name.
Considering the fact that its scale is impossible to determine,
we will never truly know the internal characteristics of ⨝,
as they would allow us to determine its scale.

However, even so, we can still go beyond. We can **always** go beyond, for there is always something higher.
And it is that idea that inspired our second hypernumber: **let’s keep going**,
typically denoted simply as LKG.

LKG is simply the object embodying the idea that we can always go higher.
It’s a very broad idea, and as such it can encompass a lot of lesser objects,
including ⨝. However, there is still one thing that can outcompete it: **boosters**.

Boosters are very powerful definitional tools that allow objects to outcompete even
the strongest definitions (to a certain extent, of course).
What a booster does is that for anything that aims to weaken an object with a booster,
the booster will counteract by upshifting the object higher than the thing weakening it in some way.
What exactly that way is depends on the booster.

The absolute most prominent example of an object with a booster is our third and final hypernumber in discussion:
**suvri propellant**, which I’ll denote with the symbol **⮍**.
The booster of ⮍ is quite special, functioning in a very unique way:
- Every time ⮍ is hindered by any other object,
  its booster defines an antipode to that object with an infinitely stronger definition and applies it on ⮍ itself.
- If an object prevents the booster from working, it nullifies that prevention.
- If an object nullifies ⮍, the booster will counteract by powering both itself and ⮍.
- If an object discards certain properties of ⮍, the booster will retain them.
